    "# Weekly Trade Performance (12-17 Jan 2026)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second trading week of January converted five macro headlines into FX-heavy, cross-asset relative value expressions centred on policy regime shifts, geopolitical credibility risk, and cross-border divergence. The process showed continued strength in idea formation, RV structuring, catalyst alignment, and horizon discipline.\n",
    "Performance across the five simulated trades showed positive expectancy, with notable strength in macro RV spreads and weaker results where instrument purity or factor contamination reduced the ability to isolate the intended thesis.\n",
    "\n",

    "##  Performance Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all 5 ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dimension             | Assessment                    |\n",
    "|-----------------------|-------------------------------|\n",
    "| Idea Quality          | High (policy & geopolitical focused)                          |\n",

    "### Top Performer\n",
    "**USD Credibility Short vs Safe-Havens (12 Jan)** — diversified safe-haven basket, clean thesis, +19bps avg, 57% win rate, low stop-outs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notable Positive Contributors:\n",
    "-   **DXJ (Japan Hedged EQ) vs JGB Proxy (14 Jan)** → +70bps avg, convex, catalyst-driven\n",
    "-   **Long CAD/CNH vs Short USD (17 Jan)** → +10bps avg, trade-detente catalyst worked structurally → +140 bps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Underperformers:\n",
    "-   **EUR vs GBP Stagflation Divergence (13 Jan)** → USD contamination + wrong historical regime\n",
    "-   **Korea (EWY) vs Germany (FXE) (16 Jan)** → semiconductor equity vol dominated FX thesis\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "##  PnL Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Using backtested sample PnLs (equal-weighted model book):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expected Weekly PnL: +9bps\n",
    "- Return Distribution: positively skewed\n",
    "- Hit Rate (across 5 trades): 3/5 positive expectancy\n",
    "- Convexity: Present in 2 trades (Japan & Korea themes)\n",
    "- Left-Tail Profile: Limited — no catastrophic negative tail\n",
    "- Capital Preservation: Achieved (no model blow-ups, stops triggered appropriately)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The book behaved like a well-constructed discretionary macro RV sleeve: small positive carry, convex right tail, low left tail.\n",

    "##  Key Takeaways from PnL Attribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positive Trades Shared 3 Features:\n",
    "1. Policy or geopolitics-based catalysts\n",
    "2. Relative value construction (hedged beta)\n",
    "3. Cross-border divergence with identifiable windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- USD credibility short (Fed independence risk)\n",
    "- Takaichi trade (JP EQ vs JGB) (fiscal–monetary divergence)\n",
    "- CAD/CNH detente basket (tariff & trade regime shift)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Negative Trades Shared 2 Features:\n",
    "1. Instrument purity issues (EWY ≠ KRW, FXB/FXE USD contamination)\n",
    "2. Regime mismatch (EURGBP backtest reflects 2020–2025 dynamics, not 2026 forward thesis)\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- EURGBP reflected historical ECB hiking lag, not UK stagflation\n",
    "- KRW basket reflected semiconductor cycle, not currency policy\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Pattern Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "Two patterns emerged clearly:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(i) Edge Exists in Macro RV with Policy Divergence**\n",
    "\n",
    "I consistently added value where:\n",
    "- governments intervened (US vs Fed, Japan fiscal, China/Canada detente)\n",
    "- currencies reflected policy credibility, not risk sentiment\n",
    "- spreads decomposed fundamentals from beta\n",
    "\n",
    "**(ii) Weakness Exists in Structural Instrument Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "Signals were weakened by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- USD beta leakage (FXE/FXB)\n",
    "- Equity-contaminated FX proxies (EWY)\n",
    "- Wrong volatility calibration (GBP stops too tight for FX macro window)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*“I ran five macro RV trades. My strongest results came from USD credibility, Japan’s fiscal divergence, and CAD/CNH trade détente — all of which monetise policy differentials with clear catalysts. The weaker performers were not macro errors, but instrument purity and regime mismatch issues: EURGBP was contaminated by USD and backtested in the wrong regime, and EWY introduced semiconductor equity beta into what should have been a KRW trade. The key takeaway is that my edge is in macro-relative-value with cross-border catalysts, and I need to improve instrument purity, factor neutralisation, and horizon calibration. I’ve begun addressing this by prioritising direct crosses over USD ETFs, tightening catalyst windows, and adjusting stops to vol regimes.”*"
