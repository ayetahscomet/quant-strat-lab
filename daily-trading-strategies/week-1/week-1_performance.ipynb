    "# Weekly Trade Performance (5-9 Jan 2026)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first trading week of January was used to translate five macro news items into tactical trade expressions across equities, FX, and cross-asset relative value. The week demonstrated a consistent process, clean thesis articulation, and disciplined horizon management. Performance across the five simulated trades was mixed positive, with notable strengrth in macro-driven relative value spreads and weaker results in single-stock directional trades or factor heavy expressions.\n",

    "### Top Performer\n",
    "**EM AI Hardware vs Software Spread** - strong structural theme, clean RV, realised +15% on first sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notable Positive Contributors:\n",
    "-   **Southern Europe vs Core Europe (Equity RV)** → +70bps avg, 71% win rate\n",
    "-   **Long CNY vs Short EUR (FX Fundamentals)** → +140 bps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Underperformers:\n",
    "-   **US vs EU Oil Majors Spread** → Slightly negative, factor-contaminated\n",
    "-   **Long Live Nation** → Mild negative; horizon mismatch with simulation window\n",

    "##  Key Takeaways from PnL Attribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positive Trades Shared 3 Features:\n",
    "1. Policy or fundamentals-based catalysts\n",
    "2. Relative value construction (long vs short)\n",
    "3. De-risked beta exposure\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- Europe RV (policy + fiscal + growth)\n",
    "- Hardware Spread (cycle + valuation + capex)\n",
    "- CNH/EUR (real FX + flows + geopolitics)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Negative Trades Shared 2 Features:\n",
    "1. **Feature contamination** (Oil Beta, Risk-On/Off)\n",
    "2. **Horizon mismatch** (live entertainment thesis too long-term)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Pattern Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "I seem to be strongest on macro-driven spreads with cross-border divergence and fundamental catalysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"I ran five trades off macro headlines. The strongest results cam from macro-relative-value spreads - Southern European equities versus core Europe, EM AI hardware vs software, and CNH vs EUR - all positive with clean catalysts and well aligned horizons. The oil majors RV idea was conceptually correct but contaminated by crude beta and the Live Nation long was directionally vulnerable due to horizon mismatch. The main takeaways are that my edge is in macro RV with cross-border catalysts, and I need to improve factor neurralisation and exection horizon control. I've already adapted my template to incorporate factor matrices, compounding stops, trade taxonomy, and blotter exports.\"*"
