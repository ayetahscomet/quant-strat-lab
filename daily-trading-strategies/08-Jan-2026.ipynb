    "**Long CNY Recovery vs Short EUR Exposure (The Real-Terms Convergence)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Client Pitch\n",
    "\n",
    "*As of January 8, 2026, the CNY presents a masive tactical opportunity driven by a stark divergence between nominal strengrh and real-term depreciation. While the PBoC has kept the CNY/USD pair steady, the currency is down 15-20% in inflation-adjusted terms since 2021 against its broader trading partners. We are pitching a long CNY position against EUR. With European exporters already losing competitiveness due to a rising EUR/CNY, and hedge fund conviction mounting for a significant 2026 revaluation to combat trade surplus criticism, we beleive the coiled spring of CNY is ready to snap higher.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why now\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real Value Mean Reversion**: The 15-20% real depreciation since 2021 is unsustainable given China's explosive trade surplus; a correction toward fundamental value is overdue in 2026\n",
    "- **Geopolicical De-escalation**: A substantial CNY appreciation serves as a diplomatic olive branch to mitigate international trade tensions\n",
    "- **EUR Vulnerability**: As the EUR/USD and EUR/CNY have risen recently, European manufacturing is becoming uncompetitive, making the Euro the ideal funding leg for a CNY long"

    "- While China faces a deflationary slup, allowing the currency to strengthen can actually help transition the economy towards domestic consumption by increasing the purchasing power of the Chinese consumer\n",
    "- The current explosive trade surplus is a political liability; currency appreciation is the most efficint lever to normalise trade relations\n",
