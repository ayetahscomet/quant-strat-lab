    "**Long Live Entertainment Infrastructure vs Short Consumer Discretionary Displacement**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Client Pitch\n",
    "\n",
    "*As a January 9, 2026, the live entertainment sector presents a massive tactical opportunity driven by a suppy-demand squeeze. While global superstar touring volume for 2026 is projected to hit record highs, the 2026 FIFA World Cup and Winter Olympics will create a temporary \"venue drought\" by locking out major stadiums and diverting consumer eyeballs. We are pitching a long position in Live Nation Entertainment. With the stock trading near $147.21 and a robust pipeline of 26 million tickets already sold, we believe themarket is underestimating the \"experience premium\" that will allow top-tier live events to outpace broader discretionary spending shifts in 2026.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why now\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Venue Scarcity Premium**: The 2026 World Cup stadium lockouts will decrease supply of avaliable dates for mega-tours, allowing promoters like lIve nation to command higher pricing power for the remaining dates\n",
    "- **Record Touring Volume**: 2026 is confirmed as the strongest year in recent history for total artists on tour, with various artists already booking out arenas\n",
    "- **Structural Experience Shift**: Post-2025 data shows consumers are prioritising high-profile events (Concerts/Sports) over traditional retail, making LYV a prime beneficiary of the experience-first economy"

    "\n",
    "### Macro Hypothesis\n",
    "- Despite the crowding-out risk from the FIFA World CUp, Live Nation's integrated model (Ticketing + Promotion) allows it to capture revenue even as venue availability tightens\n",
    "- The 2026 DOJ trial in March is a known overhang that has already been priced in at current valuations, providing a tactical entry point before summer earnings\n",
    "- The explosion in music tourisim in North America and Europe creates a localised spending boost that offsets general consumer discretionary weakness\n",

    "**Short leg (synthetic)**\n",
    "- The trade is focused on the idiosyncratic strength of live events over general discrretionary spending; no buying protection or options insurance is used in this structure"
