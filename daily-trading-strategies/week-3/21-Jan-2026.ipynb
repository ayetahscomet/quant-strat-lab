    "> Long the tech-driven, cost-superior growth of clean energy (ICLN) while shorting the debt-burdened legacy utility model (XLU) to exploit the gap between poltical rhetoric and the actual economic deployment of AI-ready-power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Client/Desk Pitch (30 seconds):**\n",
    "> The market is overreacting to 'anti-green' headlines while ignoring the 2026 reality: solar costs are now 55% lower than natural gas. We are seeing a 46% surge in solar generation because traditional utilities can't build fossil-fuel plants fast enough to cool AI data centeers. By going Long ICLN / Short XLU, we capture the inevitable shift to the cheapest, fastest-to-market energy source while hedging against the broader utility sectors's infrastructure delays and rising fossil-fuel Capex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Now:**\n",
    "- AI Power Inflection: Data center demand is not scaling non-linearly, forcing utilities to choose the only energy source that can be deployed in <12 months: Solar\n",
    "- LCOE Tipping Point: 2026 data confirms solar at $50/MWh vs natural gas at $115/MWh; the economic choice is now decoupled from federal tax credits\n",

    "**What went right:**\n",
    "- The fundamental economics of the theme worked in favourable rate environments → solar/clean energy outperformed legacy utilities.\n",
    "- Positive right-tail events captured: when 10Y yields softened or paused, ICLN squeezed higher and delivered strong +6% to +8.5% outcomes.\n",
    "- Sector dispersion was real: Utilities lagged due to balance sheet leverage + capex drag while clean energy rode growth/multiple expansion.\n",
    "- Asymmetric payoff profile despite coin-flip win rate: Average PnL > 0 with solid right skew → indicates a valid macro RV signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What went wrong:**\n",
    "- Rates-duration spillover dominated the stop-outs: rising US yields crushed ICLN before the thematic thesis could play out.\n",
    "- Holding period too long (120D) for a factor-volatile, rates-sensitive expression → forced high stop-out frequency.\n",
    "- Factor mismatch: Long leg behaves like growth + duration, short leg behaves like value + defensive.\n",
    "- Execution blind spot: No filter for rate regimes; stops were hit during Fed repricing, not because the thematic thesis failed.\n",

    "**Factor that actually drove results:**\n",
