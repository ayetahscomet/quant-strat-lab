# Project Structuring

Objectives when structuring:
    -   Reproducibility
    -   Separation of research vs production code
    -   Clean import in python
    -   Easy navigation
    -   Scalability (small projects > full research repo > production pipeline)

Folder-by-folder logic:

data/
    raw/        # untouched original data
    interim/    # lightly cleaned (e.g., NaNs handled)
    processed/  # ready-for-modelling, features created

-   If it's a CSV/Prquet/h5/JSON etc, it goes here
-   No Python code ever goes here
-   Keeps all data out of code folders
-   Prevents pushing large files into Git (usually you add /data/ to .gitignore)

notebooks/
-   Home to brainstorming and rough experiments
-   Focusses on:
        -   Exploratory data analysis   |
        -   Idea generation             |
        -   Rough feature tests         |- They're not for production code
        -   Visual checks               |
        -   Debugging ideas             |

reports/
    figures/            |
    tables/             |- Anything generated "by" the project goes here
    logs/               |
    final_report.md     |

src/
    backtest/
    data/
    experiments/
    models/
    utils/
    __init__.py

    -   src/data/ focusses of functions ie data loading, processing, transformation functions etc
    -   src/models/ focusses on modelling logic
    -   src/backtest/ is our backtesting engine and focusses of execution rules
    -   src/experiments/ are scripts that combine everything
    -   src/utils/ focusses of general helper functions ie logging, plotting, mathematical utilities, etc

    src/ can be used for clean imports and modularity ie "from src.models.garch import GARCHModel"

\README.md
    A human intro to the project

\requirement.txt
    Records a list of the Python libraries used, prevening version conflicts, and clean intallation on a new server

\notation.txt
    This is hyper-quant specific for understanding and readability

/main.py
    Acts as the central controller of the pipeline
    -   It's written in a way that is eary to extend as your project grows
