## Cross-Sectional Commodity Momentum & Carry Strategy Analysis

Design, implement, and evaluate a cross-sectional long–short strategy across multiple commodities based on:

-   Carry (term-structure slope)
-   Momentum (12-month trailing returns)
-   Mean reversion filter (short-term price deviation from trend)

This project simulates synthetic price data for six commodities and backtests factor-based portfolios over time.
