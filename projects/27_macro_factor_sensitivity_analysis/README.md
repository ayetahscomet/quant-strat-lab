## Macro-Factor Sensitivity and PCA-Based Portfolio Construction Analysis

This project explores how asset returns respond to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, interest rates, and GDP growth. 

The goal is to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to uncover latent economic drivers and then build a portfolio optimised for specific macro exposures.
