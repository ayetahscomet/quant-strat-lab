# Simulating Pure versus Dirty Dispersion Trading

Inspired by "Quant Insider Technical Series (November 12, 2025)"

Objective:
    The simulate and analyse a dispersion trading strategy under both pure (theoretical) and dirty (realistic) conditions.

    This will include building a full model using:
        -   Stock-level volatilites
        -   Stock-level correlations
        -   Option-implied surfaces
    
    We will evaulate how trading frictions affect probability.

    The assignment should demonstrate a clear understanding of volatility decomposition, correlation exposure, and P&L attribution under realistic market conditions.
