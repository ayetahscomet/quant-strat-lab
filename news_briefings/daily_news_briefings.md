ETFs:    "Rapid growth of US tax-minimising ETFs draws scrutiny"

*Steve Johnson in London*

-   A number of fund firms have been creating ETFs that either lower the interest or dividend income that can be taxed, or alternatively reduce capital gains tax on investors’ pre-existing stock portfolios
-   Some US politicians are already opposing these funds. In June, Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate finance committee, put forward legislation that would prevent tax-free transfers of appreciated securities to 351 funds
-   ETFs have always been more tax efficient than more traditional mutual funds in the US, due to a quirk in the tax system. Whereas mutual funds often trigger a capital gains tax event when they sell profitable positions, ETFs can usually avoid doing so by trading “in kind” with market makers, so that no cash changes hands

-   “From a tax fairness point of view the investor has brilliantly avoided taxes and has had access to a good portion of his or her assets, and everyone else in the country has been deprived of that money for the Treasury” - Elisabeth Kashner (Director, FactSet)

Outages:  "CME trading outage disrupts global markets"

*Nikou Asgari, Camilla Hodgson, Emily Herbert and Rachel Rees*
    
-   tHE Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the largest derivatives, experienced a data outage for ~10 hours binging futures trading to a hault; This impacted asset classes including equities, bonds, currencies, and commodities; It has caused investors to consider their exchange-market consentration risks
-   CME said the stop was due to a cooling issue at a data centre 35 miles from their headquarters; Disruptions resemble the three hour 2019 CME outage; Thankfully the outage occured the day following US Thanksgiving
-   The issue lies in the issues occuring on the last trading day of November ie the day were the majority of options expiry and new posiitions are entered; Due to investor trade reluctant their was more dynamic bid-ask pricing from the sell-side across asset classes
-   Post-outage the CME stock traded up, surprising retail investors; When asked for reasoning an interesting comment was made: "Same reason Amazon was up on the day of the global AWS outage? Market reminded of the company's global reach and criticality"; Systematic importances' true value is only known under stress

Gilts:    "UK signals expansion of short-term debt market in ‘radical’ borrowing shift"

*Ian Smith and Rachel Rees in London*

-   Investors are expecting a ridical shift away from long term borrowing by the UK government, as they shared that they were considering selling more short-term Treasury bills; These short term bills only currently make up 3.72% of circulating UK sovereign debt
-   The UK are attempting to lower their interest bill by shortening debt maturity dates; Currently 1m Tbills yield 4.05%, while 30s have fallen to 5.21%
-   Leaning more heavily on short-dated borrow creates more exposure to swings in interest rates, as they would have to return to the market more frequency to refinance their debt
-   In the US, short term instruments account for 20% of their outstanding government debt; This was a Biden-era policy that was critised yet continued; The key counterargument to the UK moving in this direction is the issue of natural demand

Currencies:    "Why China needs to let the renminbi rise"

*Weijian Shan*

-   CNY is severly undervalued especially, when juxtaposed to Hong Kong's HKD, which is pegged to the USD; Using the economist's Big Mac Index CNY appears to be in excess  ~41% undervalued
-   It is beleived that a steady appreciation in RMB would boost domestic consumption and improve trade relations; For 32 years China has run a surplus and has exceeded its capital account deficits and growing USD 3.3 tn in foreign exchange reserves
-   USD/RMB has never traded below 1:8.7 since 1994, even under the 1996-98 Asian financial crisis, or during the 2008-2009; It seems that China has found a way to achieve stability and credibility through undervaluation
-   Even with China's steady 5% annual GDP growth since 2023, China needs to curb their export dependence and move towards domestic consumption, which would only be encourage by astrong CNY

Currencies:    "Currency traders bet against sterling ahead of Budget"

*Ian Smith and Rachel Rees in London*

-   Traders are expecting today's UK Autumn Budget to push USD/GBP up, on tax-rising fears; In fact, trading volumes in GBP/USD puts have increased with put prices trading up; puts are oversubscribed to calls 4x over (CME Group); The exceptation of the BoE cutting rates is weighing on currency valuations
-   Reeves with need a goldilocks scenario for everyone to win as a result of this budget; Taxes rises need to be small enough to not weigh heavily on consumers and High enough that signals to investors that they will achieve the parties self-imposed budget
-   GBP was up 0.6% at 1.318 against the dollar by yesterday afternoon, but that was dollar-ideosyncratic; The GBP/EUR is a more accurate measure of strength, showing GBP's slide against the EUR, bottoming out at ~1.13; This view is primarily being expressed through currency forwards
-   Gilt Yields are inverted-to-flat in recent data, with expectations of a 25-bp cut in December; If Reeves is able to create sufficient fiscal headroom, clearly dispel fears of futher tax rises in the coming year, and deliver news on growth sterling could rally, putting 1 in 4 put investors out of the money 
-   The bet currently is that short-dated gilts are BoE conditional, with little movement expected on that front; however, if long-dated gilts are skewed then the BoE, Labour Government, etc, as a result of today's budget, further panic will insue in need of correction: "I haven't heard anyone say good news about sterling and UK in the last three months" - Steve englander, (SCB)

UK Autumn Budget 2025:    "What big bond investors want from the UK Budget"

*Ian Smith, Senior Markets Correspondent*

-   Reeves must deliver a budget that simultaneously cuts spending and raises money without fulling inflation; Earlier this month the plan to raise income tax was scrapted prompting a sell-off; The market is positioned as though to state that the UK government will not be able to increase their headroom against their self-imposed borrowing limits
-   The street expects a _minimum_ of higher taxes and modest spending cuts to expand fiscal headroom to ~£15bn; Discipline in reaffirming current fiscal rules, commitment to fiscal consolidation, realistic productivity growth projection; Failure to achieve this would likely trigger a rally in gilt yields
-   The street is keeping an eye of for language that hints at reduced inflation (The UK cannot afford to put upward pressure on near-term inflation): reduced levies on energy bills, a credible approach to reforming spending etc: These would increase the likelihood of BoE rate cuts supporting growth and reduced debt-servicing costs
-   A budget that is good for the gilt market is not neccessarily good for the UK enconomy; but a Budget that's bad for gilts would see borrowing costs soar, which is definitely bad for the economy: “Higher taxes are not needed in the upcoming Budget. In an economy like the UK, which already has a historically high tax burden, raising taxes won’t translate into material revenue gains, as this impairs growth and deters wealth creation. What the bond market would rather see is more action to tackle runaway welfare spending." - Mark Dowding (RBC BlueBay Asset Management)

Hedge Funds:  "What US hedge funds are shorting right now"

*Robin Wigglesworth*
    
-   Goldman Sachs' report on hedge fund positioning showed that smart money is not yet shorting their AI-motived investments, but are looking into their weaker members; This file gathers delayed data based on 982 hedge funds with $4tn of gross equity positions (2.6 long, 1.4 short): Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Alphabet are the five most common bets by US hedge funds tallied by Goldman
-   S&P shorting is at the 99th percentile relative to the past five years, and well above the long term average since 1995; Short interest in the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 is a touch higher (2.5%), but the biggest rise is present in small-caps (Russel 2000)
-   From the "median stock short interest as shares of market cap" chart, Utilities is at one of its highest levels historically recorded, which is being treated as a proxy for the AI bubble, due to their use to fuel AI models; Ordered, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Eberge, and Real Estate are experiencing significant shorting (Please note, these are proportional to their history of shorting, not overall)
-   Overall, Tesla continues to be the most common short, with shorts valued at $33 billion as of 31-Oct-2025; Interesting new entries to the largest stock positions are JPM, Robinhood Markets, Oracle and Intel; However, note, that that these new entries can be classified as AI players or exceptionally frothy AI adjacent stocks
-   When considering stocks over $25 billion with largest short interest as a % of their market cap, Bloom Energy Corp, a heavy electrical equipment company, tops the list at 18% taking an Avg of 3 days for hedgefunds to liquidate their position; An overwhelming majority of stocks on this list are IT-AI adjacent companies

*Joe Leahy in Beijing*

-   China is pitching, a limited-detail rare earths initiative; Chinese production of rate earths was a point of contension in the trade wars with the US; China is keen to build ties with resource-rich countries
-   This has been titled the "international economic and trade co-operation inicative on green minerals"; 19+ nations, including massive commodity ports like Cambodia, Nigeria, Myanmar, are to participate in the allience
-   No quantifiers have been attached to this initiatve as it is in early stages, but the idea is anchored in the "better safeguarding [of] the interests of developing countries"
-   Earlier in the year, in retaliation to US tarrifs, China imposed export licences with controls for rate earths; The US are intent on reshaping the global green mineral resource supplt chain to curb China's resource imports

European Banks:  "European banks offer investors sweeteners as rally fades"

*Simon Foy and Emily Herbert in London*
    
-   European banks are on the tail end of recent rallies, and are handing out incentives; BNPP and SOCGEN accelerated their share buyback programmes, handing a combined ¢2.15bn to investors earlier than anticipated; DB also revealed new targets of faster growth and lower costs, by 2028, but announcement failed to impress investors with stocks falling 3%
-   The Euro Stoxx Banks index climbed >60% between January and mid-August; The European banking industry is facing a more difficult period as falling interest rates are putting pressure on their net interest margins
-   Lenders, Santander, Intea Sanpaolo and UniCredit are now value between 1.3 and 1.5 times book (S&PGlobal); BBVA's shares are priced as high as 1.8 times book
-   PM's are being selective on EU lenders; Analysts are largely bullish; Loan growth is back, ECB rates are at 2%, and there is an upward-sloping yield curve

Global Economy:    "How long will the dearth of US data persist?"

*Alexandra White in New York, Rachel Rees in London and Olaf Storbeck in Frankfurt*

-   The Bureau of Economic Analysis has postponed two releases that were due out on 26-Nov; Data postponed includes Q3GDP and September Inflation; The next Fed rate decision is due 10-Dec, so delays may force the the act with limited data (which would increase the likeihood of a rate-hold, rather than cut)
-   Q3GDP is polling at 3% (down from 38% in Q2) signalling comparative economic strength (post Q1's negative reading); Inflation (usually measured with the index of cre personal consumption expenditures) is polling at 2.9%, unchanged from August; This comes after the Bureau of Labor Statistics's NFP for October has been outright cancelled
-   In October, the IMF upgraded its outlook for the US, but warned that the AI-investment-surge was the main mover - This raises similar concerns to the "dotcom bubble"

Emergigng Markets:  "Hedge funds’ bets on Argentina pay off after US bailout"

*Joseph Cotterill and Costas Mourselas in London*
    
-   Newly Appointed, Javier Milei's electoral win began a run on ARS, which threatened to wipe out the country's foreign currency reserves; This only adds to a strong year for EM investor's amidst dollar weakness
-   The US bailout, boosted the prices of ARG's Dollar bond (maturing 2038), forcing yields down, due to the percieved reduced risk premium; The US offering was a backstop contingency plan providing a secondary source of funds
-   Investors are computing the likeihood of Milei's government even being able to source dollars to rebuild its foreign currency reserves, while keeping the peso's value within a trading band; Many investors believe the band is keeping ARS overvalued, making it harder for the government to strengthen reserves
-   2025 is shaping to be the strongest year for EM funds post 2017; strengthening EM currencies have helped ZAR, NGN, MXN keep inflation down while cutting interest rates

*Kate Duguid in New York, Claire Jones in Washington and Emily Herbert and Ian Smith in London*

-   Nasdaq and S&P rallied 0.9% and 1% respectively upon a Fed official signalling Dec rate cuts; this gain was expressed through consumer discretionary, healthcare, industrial and tech sectors; note, techs moves were more ideosyncratic over valuation scepticisms
-   John Williams was the official to signal openness to 0.25% cut; this would be the third conservative cut
-   Williams statement was idealised as the jobless rate hit the highest level since 2021; the street is pricing a 70% chance of a December Cut (21-Nov-2025), a significant just from the 40% priced the prior day (20-Nov-2025)
-   Side note: analysts have warned that tumbling bitcoin prices could fource retail investors to liquidate other assets (e.g. stocks) to meet marking calls

Federal Reserve:    "Top Fed official warns on risk hedge funds pose to $30tn Treasury market"

*Claire Jones in Washington and Kate Duguid in New York*

-   Lisa Cook, Fed Board Governor, voiced distain for hedge-fund's UST basis trades (pricing discrepencies) are impacting market functionality
-   In October 2025 the Fed published research highlighting a significant increase in offshore hedge funds' exposure to USTs
-   The basis trading strategy was at the centre of the March 2020 Pandemic Stress, 2019 Repo Crisis, etc
-    The Fed said last month it would halt the latest tightening programme starting 01-December, with speculation that the Fed could expand its T-bill holdings early next year
    -   This would effectively be a QE-style strategy acting independently amidst tightening


US Treasury Bonds:  "Foreign investors snap up Japanese government bonds as yields surge"

*Elettra Ardissino in London*
    
-   Foreign investors are heavy in long-dated JGBs, due to price drops (ie yield hikes)
-   Japanese data show foreigners long net $71.8bn (10y) (0ctober-2025); record high 3.41% JGBs (30y); 2.88% JGBs (20y)
-   Due to the effects of currency hedging, foreigners are recieving an added return differenial on long-dated JGBs = short-term_borrowing_costs_yen - other_majors
-   Recent regulations require JPN instutitonal investors to remain equally weighted in asset and liability positions, preventing large-scale bond participation.
-   BOJ are also reducing short-dated easing efforts, and hence tapering purchases of long-dated bonds (10s25s); essentially between insitiutions and the BOJ 10s25s are open season to foreigners; supply is high, prices are dropping, long-dated yields are being pushed up

**26-Nov-2025***:

EMB close up 0.26%, however if the UK Budget proves strong, we expect USD/GBP to strengthen, pushing the index down; AGG lused up 0.16%; IVV closed up 0..94% which was welcomed by the market; DBC closed down -0.53%; GOVT closed up 0.22%, a moddest 0.05 price increase


**25-Nov-2025**:

EMB closed up by 0.21% from the day prior; AGG interestingly traded up 0.20% at yesterday's close, with no movement (0.00%) in pre-market trades, believe to be encouraged by the Nasdaq's success (+2.69%); DBC is trading at 22.64 (+0.49%); GOVT is trading with stability with a minor 0.02-0.04 change from close to pre-market; S&P closed up at close (1.48%), but is skewing negative (-0.03%) pre-market

**24-Nov-2025**:

EMB 96.15 (at close on 21st); AGG pre-market is trading up 0.16%; GOVT is trading at + 0.04 , hence up  0.17%; DBC is trading down - 0.04% pre-market, with a risk-off sentiment dominating the commodities index; IVV is trading at 0.19% pre-market with yields experiencing downward pressure indicitive of a risk-on environment

**23-Nov-2025** (Closed):
WoW Expections:
-    GOVT prices are expected to continue on their downward trend with key data releases expected to point toward economic contraction. This is expected to push yields up. Additionally, with fresh shorted-dated supply entering the market, this can only push yields up.
-    EMB is expected to have a strong week, with reduced price pressure. With all eyes on the US, upward prices are expected, with tighter spreads on EM supply.
-    AGG's stochastic behaviour is expected to continue, due to changing impacts of Fed cuts in various bond sectors. However, if the market chooses to reprice in line with Fed cut expectations, a risk-on environment with heightened bond risk premiums may emerge. We expect prices to trade down WoW.
-    With commodities being the main channel of inflationary pressure, this week's EU Inflation data will be a mover, with a downward trend expecting to continue. The market is pricing a low ~2% +/- 0.2 YoY figure. Falling inflation would typically dampen commodity prices, so the impact on the DBC depends on whether the market views this as a sign of easing pressures or a temporary blip.
-    IVV, a market that thrives on volatility, is expected to witness wider spreads and significant data-by-data variances. This week, we expect the S&P to strengthen due to our hypothesis of weak data, which could lead to a repricing of rate fundamentals and an expectation of December rate cuts, forcing prices up.


**22-Nov-2025** (Closed):

EMB prices closed down ~0.0834% due Fed-Dec-cut-expectations; AGG priced 100.28 - 100.50 on day; GOVT closed high on the week with the market pricing in lower yields; DBCs downward pressure continued from 19-present accounting for the repricing of an expected high-commodity-risk-premium; S&P gained 6.51 on 662.28 at close

**21-Nov-2025**:    

0.5086% EMB drawdown; AGG-2d drawdown of 0.2094%; crenellation theme seen throughout 1d yields on GOVT; DBC trading down assumingly due as "global steel production capacity; to exceed demand by 38% by 2027"; S&P earning a 1.16% yield
