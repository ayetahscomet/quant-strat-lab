Global Economy:    "How long will the dearth of US data persist?"

*Alexandra White in New York, Rachel Rees in London and Olaf Storbeck in Frankfurt*

-   The Bureau of Economic Analysis has postponed two releases that were due out on 26-Nov; Data postponed includes Q3GDP and September Inflation; The next Fed rate decision is due 10-Dec, so delays may force the the act with limited data (which would increase the likeihood of a rate-hold, rather than cut)
-   Q3GDP is polling at 3% (down from 38% in Q2) signalling comparative economic strength (post Q1's negative reading); Inflation (usually measured with the index of cre personal consumption expenditures) is polling at 2.9%, unchanged from August; This comes after the Bureau of Labor Statistics's NFP for October has been outright cancelled
-   In October, the IMF upgraded its outlook for the US, but warned that the AI-investment-surge was the main mover - This raises similar concerns to the "dotcom bubble"

-   Investors are computing the likeihood of Milei's government even being able to source dollars to rebuild its foreign currency reserves, while keeping the peso's value within a trading band; Many investors believe the band is keeping ARS overvalued, making it harder for the government to strengthen reserves
-   2025 is shaping to be the strongest year for EM funds post 2017; strengthening EM currencies have helped ZAR, NGN, MXN keep inflation down while cutting interest rates

-   Recent regulations require JPN instutitonal investors to remain equally weighted in asset and liability positions, preventing large-scale bond participation.
-   BOJ are also reducing short-dated easing efforts, and hence tapering purchases of long-dated bonds (10s25s); essentially between insitiutions and the BOJ 10s25s are open season to foreigners; supply is high, prices are dropping, long-dated yields are being pushed up

**23-Nov-2025** (Closed):
WoW Expections:
-    GOVT prices are expected to continue on their downward trend with key data releases expected to point toward economic contraction. This is expected to push yields up. Additionally, with fresh shorted-dated supply entering the market, this can only push yields up.
EMB is expected to have a strong week, with reduced price pressure. With all eyes on the US, upward prices are expected, with tighter spreads on EM supply.
-    AGG's stochastic behaviour is expected to continue, due to changing impacts of Fed cuts in various bond sectors. However, if the market chooses to reprice in line with Fed cut expectations, a risk-on environment with heightened bond risk premiums may emerge. We expect prices to trade down WoW.
-    With commodities being the main channel of inflationary pressure, this week's EU Inflation data will be a mover, with a downward trend expecting to continue. The market is pricing a low ~2% +/- 0.2 YoY figure. Falling inflation would typically dampen commodity prices, so the impact on the DBC depends on whether the market views this as a sign of easing pressures or a temporary blip.
-    IVV, a market that thrives on volatility, is expected to witness wider spreads and significant data-by-data variances. This week, we expect the S&P to strengthen due to our hypothesis of weak data, which could lead to a repricing of rate fundamentals and an expectation of December rate cuts, forcing prices up.


**22-Nov-2025** (Closed):

EMB prices closed down ~0.0834% due Fed-Dec-cut-expectations; AGG priced 100.28 - 100.50 on day; GOVT closed high on the week with the market pricing in lower yields; DBCs downward pressure continued from 19-present accounting for the repricing of an expected high-commodity-risk-premium; S&P gained 6.51 on 662.28 at close

**21-Nov-2025**:    

0.5086% EMB drawdown; AGG-2d drawdown of 0.2094%; crenellation theme seen throughout 1d yields on GOVT; DBC trading down assumingly due as "global steel production capacity; to exceed demand by 38% by 2027"; S&P earning a 1.16% yield
