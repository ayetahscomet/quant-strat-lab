Soverign bonds:    "Italy and Spain shake off ‘periphery’ tag as borrowing premiums hit 16-year low"

*Ian Smith in London, Barney Jopson in Madrid and Amy Kazmin in Rome*

-   Italy and Spain have seen borrowing costs at a 16y low, relative to Germany, due to successfully tightening fiscal spending; They are standouts relative to the rest of the Eurozone; Investors are expressing this through extra yield on 10 IT bonds narrowed significantly signifying higher prices, and higher prices; Spain has cut their 10y spread (the difference between risky-bonds and the risk free rate), indicative of perceived stability
-   This is a trend seen across southern european markets, which are offering more stability and enactable fiscal measures when compared to France, Belgium, and Austria; Their struggle to produce budget deficits is impalpable 
-   Whilst both countries are employing different strategies - Spain through medium-term economic growth and Italy through prudent fiscal poilcies - their momentum has carried through the south (ie Portugal and Greece); The investors swing felt in the south feels more decisive with spreads trading tightly, their is one overriding view present
-   Spains growth is prompted by a combination of immigration, tourism, lower energy costs and EU funds; Spain's budget deficit is set to reduce by 0.7 per cent of GDP from 2024-2026; Italy's economy is mose suggish but Giorgia Meloni's commitment to deficit reduction even amidst a cost-of-living squeeze is creating confidence from external investors

Eurozone:  "Bulgaria joins Eurozone despite pro-Russian disinformation"

*Marton Dunai in Budapest*
    
-   Bulgaria became the 21st country to adopt the euro as a primary trading currency, following Croatia who adopted it in 2023; Bulgaria has undergone recent political instability over the last five years, including but not limited to, a cabinet collapse, corrumption allegations, and the absence of a 2026 budget
-   When assessing civilian sentiment, 40 per cent support the choice to join the eurozone; the lack of support is driven by fears that local exchanges will round up prices during conversions; Far-right parties have called for a traditional referendum relating to the euro, interestingly, all countries to have ever adopted a euro referendum have denied it, including Denmark and sweden
-   The switch from the Bulgarian lev to the euro is expected to have limited immediate economic impact, since the national currency has been pegged to the Deutsche mark and later the euro since the 1990s to guard against hyperinflation
