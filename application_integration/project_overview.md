# Proposal: Global Daily Knowledge Challenge Application

## 1.   Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the development of a educational application designed to cultivate global awareness, curiosity, and daily engagement with cultureal and geographical knowledge. The product delivers one thoughtfully crafted question per day, encouraging users to think actively, reflect throughout the day, and participate in a global learning experience. The platform is designed to be ad-free, paywall-free and inclusive, with future monetisation driven by brand partnerships rather than user fees.

The long-term vision is to develop a flagship educational product that strengthens global literacy, encourages reflective thinking, and provides interactive, data-rich insights into how individuals compare to users around the world.

## 2.   Problem Statement

Despite globalisation and growing open-source information symmetry, many people lack structured opportunities to engage with global knowledge in a meaningful way. Traditional learning apps tend to prioritise speed, competitiveness, or memorisation rather than curiosity and reflection.

Users often want:
-   Bite-sized engaging knowledge challenges
-   A sense of daily intellectual growth
-   Insights into how their thinking compares with others
-   A platform free from ads, paywalls, or noise

There is an opportunity to build a product that reframes global education as a daily habit. 

    *Simple, reflective and rooted in genuine exploration.*

## 3.   Proposed Solution

The application will deliver a single global knowledge challenge each day. Users can view the question early in the morning, think about it throughout the day, and submit answers at any time.

After answering, users are presented with interactive data visualisation, showing:
-   How their answers compare globally
-   Which countries or demographics they most resemble in knowledge styly
-   The accuracy and completeness of their responses
-   Their speed relative to the global population
-   Their own longitudinal patterns (e.g. consistency, strengths, streaks)

This transforms learning into a reflective, habit-forming experience.

## 4.   Key Features
## 4.1  Daily Challenge System
-   One question per day, released globally
-   Question on geography, culture, language, world history, art, politics, finance, data, etc.
-   Multi-part questions
-   Optional hints or AI guided corrective feedback

## 4.2  Interactive Insights Dashboard
After submission, users receive:
-   **Percentile Speed Meter** - *"Your answered faster than 62% of users."*
-   **Country Alignment Scores** - percentile match with other countries' typical answers
-   **Correctness Breakdown** - bar charts comparing user responses with global accuracy
-   **Diversity-of-Thought Indicator** - identifying unusual or insightful thinking
-   **Streak and Progress Metrics** - calendar heatmap of daily engagement

All visualisations are presented with clean, elegant aesthetics reminiscent of Tableau dashboards.

## 4.3  Learning Philosophy
The platform values:
-   Reflective thought over immediate correctness
-   Curiosity over competition
-   Discovery over memorisation
-   Global perspective over narrow local knowledge

Hints and partial credit reward the way a user thinks, not just the final result.
